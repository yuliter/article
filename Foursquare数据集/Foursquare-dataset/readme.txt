[I]. Brief description
Foursquare is a location-based social networking website, software for mobile devices. This service is available to users with GPS enabled mobile devices, such as iPhones and Blackberries. This contains the friendship network crawled in December 2010 by Fred Morstatter (Fred.Morstatter@asu.edu). For easier understanding, all the contents are organized in CSV file format.

Number of Edges: 3,473,834
[III]. The data format

2 files are included:

1. nodes.csv
-- it's the file of all the users. This file works as a dictionary of all the users in this data set. It's useful for fast reference. It contains
all the node ids used in the dataset

2. edges.csv
-- this is the friendship network among the users. The friends are represented using edges. 
Here is an example. 

1,2

This means user with id "1" is friend with user id "2".
